Hello everyone! I am a fullstack developer currently located in Syracuse NY! I have been coding since early 2023 and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon! I currently use HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Python languages, and also am familiar with node.js and react frameworks. My favorite aspect about coding is the euphoric feeling of solving difficult problems and creating new applications for all to enjoy!

Besides being a developer, I am also an avid sports fan üèà (Go Steelers!!!) and love to workout! I also appreciate the social aspects of life, so I hang out with friends and family as much as I can! If you want to get to know me or my projects better, feel free to connect with me on my LinkedIn!
